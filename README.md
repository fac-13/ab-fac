## WHAT 

We designed a one-page responsive website, taking a mobile-first approach. 

We included three main sections: 'About, Team, and Contact' with links to these sections in the navigation bar. When a user navigates our site they can return to the top of the page by clicking our logo on the left corner of the navigation bar. 

The site provides information about our team, each member's skills and expertise and links to each member's GitHub pages. Viewers can easily navigate through the site and contact us using the form at bottom of the page.


## HOW (our journey to completion)

The process and workflow we used for the design and build is outlined below. We swapped pairs around between day 1 and 2, and alternated coding and using Git. 

1. **Planning & Design**
    - As a team, we sketched out on paper our page layout and a simple wireframe.
    - We planned our work schedule, deciding how to block out our time, and when to check in. 
    - We planned our workflow, deciding how to divide up the site elements into easily managable features for team pairs to work on. 

2. **Initial Build & Repo set up**
    - We set up our Github repo while another pair initialised a boilerplate HTML index file with basic semantic sections, as well as blank JS script and CSS style sheet.
